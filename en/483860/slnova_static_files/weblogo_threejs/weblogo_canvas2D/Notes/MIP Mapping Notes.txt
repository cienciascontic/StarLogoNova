Start by implementing something basic:
- Use canvas to draw scaled down textures to new images or see if canvas/javascript has something for MIP mapping. 
- Store levels as seperate images.
- No filtering between MIP levels. If rendering a size between MIP levels just scale up from the lower resolution level. 


Immediate Improvements:
- Implement a simple algorithm for downsizing, like averaging groups of four pixels (check to see what canvas does already to make sure you aren't doing the same thing or 
	something worse). Could also look for a javascript library that can handle MIP mapping for you. 
- See if storing MIP levels in the same image and rendering sub-sections of that image is more performant. 
- Find a way to do bilinear filtering. 


Future Improvements:
- Investiage other algorithms for downsizing that are more asthetically pleasing. More performant algorithms aren't necessarily more desireable unless MIP maps will be
	being produced on the fly. 
- Investigate trilinear filtering between two levels of a MIP map for rendering a resolution in between two levels.
